# <Prework Study guide>

## Description

The motivation behind this Study Guide was for me to get familiar with what we will be using during class. I built this project becasue it helped me understand the world of coding a little bit better.This project helps solve some questions i have about coding.I learned a hand full of things like better usage of Git Bash, Git Flow, I learned HTML has two parts the Head and the Body. The Head containing things users wont see and the Body is what the users will be able to read. I learned about CSS and how it helps style the webpage and make it look pretty. And finally JavaScript which is still a work in progress for me.
